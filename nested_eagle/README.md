## Overview

As of right now, the nested-EAGLE pipline has been configured to run on Ursa. It is possible to run these configurations on other machines; however, that will take some adjustments. A few tips are provided throughout the pipeline to help users implement this pipeline elsewhere.

See the `ursa` folder to complete the `nested-EAGLE` pipeline on Ursa.
