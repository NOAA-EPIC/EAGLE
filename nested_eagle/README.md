### Overview

See the `ursa` folder to complete the `nested_eagle` pipeline.

As of right now, the pipline has been configured to run on Ursa. It is possible to run these configurations on other machines; however, that will take some adjustments. A few tips are provided throughout the pipeline on how to implement this pipeline elsewhere.
